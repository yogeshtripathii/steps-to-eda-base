Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Retail Customer Dataset â€” Includes data cleaning and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing variables, and preparing the dataset for customer segmentation and further analysis.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

This step focused on preparing the retail customer dataset for further analysis.

### Steps Performed
- Handled **missing values** by removing or imputing where necessary.  
- Removed **duplicate records** to ensure data integrity.  
- Standardized **categorical variables** (e.g., gender, region, occupation).  
- Converted **data types** (e.g., age, income, spending score to numeric).  
- Renamed columns for consistency and easier usage.  
- Detected and treated **outliers** in income and spending data.  

### Outcome
- A **clean and structured dataset** ready for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Improved **data quality and consistency** across all customer attributes.  
- Dataset prepared for **segmentation, visualization, and modeling** in later steps.
